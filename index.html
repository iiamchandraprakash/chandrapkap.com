  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, myself <strong>Chandraprakash</strong>, born and raised in a small village nestled in the heart of eastern Odisha. 
    Growing up close to nature and community taught me the value of simplicity, hard work, and connection.
    <br><br>
    I’m someone who believes life is meant to be lived fully—whether it’s feeling the wind on my face while riding, 
    finding peace in swimming, creating magic in the kitchen, or sharing stories with new people I meet along the way.
    <br><br>
    Every experience shapes me, and I’m always open to learning, growing, and building meaningful bonds.
